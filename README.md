# TOP-foundations-landing-page
A landing page project from the foundations course on The Odin Project to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills so far. This is a desktop version and is not responsive.

What I learned:
    - Using a Virtual Machine
    - Using the terminal/command line
    - Cloning a Github repository
    - Commit early and often
    - Adding notes in my code
    - Using emmet in VS code
    - Its ok to take a break
